# D3 Widgets

## Overview

In the index.html file, you will find divs with ids, each
with a 
corresponding javascript function call which passes the 
id as the first parameter, as well as other customizations.

For example:

    <!-- Object placeholder -->
    <div id="animeIcon"></div>

    <!-- Javascript function to draw object -->
    animatedStatistic("#animeIcon", "", "12:30", "\uf017", "Hours Spent");

Each Javascript function is implemented in either 
animated.js or iconbg.js
